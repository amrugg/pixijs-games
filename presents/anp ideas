Goal of the Game:
Unlock all the Animals and defeat the Summer Siege. (Also buy the expansion for later books.)
General Rules:
You are presented with a screen. The Friend you start with is Wooly.
Wooly's games are: ["Waxi Ride 1,2,3","Honey Harvest 1,2,3","Stair Bouncing"];
You start with Waxi Ride 1. Glide down the river and don't fall off.
Completing it fast enough earns you 1 honey point. Otherwise you get nothing.
To advance to the next level you must earn 10 Honey points. The Igeron king will not attack.
To Upgrade to Waxi Ride 2, you need 12 HP(Honey Points). Buying Honey Harvest 1 costs you 15 HP, and Stair Bouncing costs 17 HP.
Levels: [10,13,14,16,20,30];
Advancing to the next level uses all of your Honey Points, and it happens immediately after you reach the threshold.
Therefore you will not be able to buy any of Wooly's upgraded games because Waxi Ride 2 costs 12 HP.
On the second level, the Igeron king may make attacks, but the chance is low, and the result will always be a slight loss in HP.
On the 3rd level, you unlock Kit.
Kit's Games Are: ["Tuna Spearing 1,2,3","Tree Climbing","Igeron King Evading 1,2,3"];
Kit comes with no games. Igeron King Evading 1 costs 9 HP, Tuna Spearing 1 costs 11 HP, and Tree Climbing costs 13 HP.
The Igeron king may attack, taking many HP if you do not buy Igeron King Evading and use it.
Igeron King Evading 1 gives you +2 HP if you win, -5 HP if you lose. Win or lose, the Igeron points go down 3.
Spot comes next at Level 4.
Spot's Games Are: ["Fetch",]
